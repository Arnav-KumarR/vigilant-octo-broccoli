This means that every child and adult associated with the school is not just important because they are members of the school but because they are seen as unique individuals within God's creation.

The spiritual aspects of life will be recognized and nurtured alongside the academic and emotional needs of all.</p>

                <p>Pollution has become one of the most concentrating issues for our planet and mankind. It takes place when pollutants contaminate our environment. In other words, pollution is responsible for disturbing the balance of the echosystem. Moreover, it impacts our lifestyle severely and also contributes greatly to global warming. As the world is getting more modern, pollution is also enhancing day by day. It's like we are the prisoners of our own creations. Further, it has become rather essential to learn about the causes, types and impact of pollution to deal with this problem.</p>

                <p>Matches are an essential part of sports. They give rise to competitive spirit and sportsmanship. Recently, I got the opportunity to witness a inter school football match that was played between two higher secondary schools of our state. The match was played at the biggest playground of one of the renown stadium. The entire ground was swept clean and the sides decorated. There were chairs on one side and the rest of the ground was open for the spectators. Both the teams were in high spirits. They were dressed in their school colours. The match started at 5pm sharp. One of the team won the toss and choose the favourable side. Soon the referee blew the whistle and the match was started. Both the teams were playing the game very well by kicking the ball to their co-players and trying to make the goal. </p>

Online menus with photographs of the meals prepared, and detailed descriptions of their ingredients help both students and parents make the right nutritional choices. Each student or staff member who accesses the canteen could be provided with a School Canteen Account on the school website that keeps track of their previous meal choices and any dietary requirements they may have. Ordering online by ticking a box and paying for meals online can eliminate all the fuss of money handling, making it safer and less complicated for staff and students alike. Here again, diversity is the key.</p>

                <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12"><b>1. Accuracy</b>
                    Humans are prone to error, even if we provide them with supporting computational devices. Automated attendance management systems ensure accurate time records and minimize the inevitable and costly errors with manual data entry. This accurate data thereby helps to provide accurate performance and payroll data.
                    <br>
                    <b>2. Economics</b>
                    Have you ever thought that attendance management systems could control costs? It saves money by putting an end to inaccurate time reporting, buddy punching, absenteeism, tardiness, time abuse, and overpayment. As a matter of fact, a study done by the Axsium Group found that large organizations save up to $1,600 per employee after implementing automated attendance management systems.
                    <br>
                   <b> 3. Productivity / Efficiency</b>
                    Monitoring and managing attendance manually can be a time-consuming, laborious, and expensive affair. It takes time to process paper sheets and time cards, create schedules, authorize leave and overtime, and create payroll manually. Free up precious administration time with an automated system that does it all for you, from keeping track of employee hours to automatically importing information into your payroll system. The time and effort saved combined with data accuracy helps in optimizing the use of resources which lead to increased productivity and improves profits.
